# Bad URL Checker
This tool allows you to check a list of URL and get a list of URLs that are broken.

## Try it out
Download this app and run `npm run dev` to get started. 

Paste a list of URLs in the textbox on the left and the app will run a fetch request for each URL and build a list of URLs that return any status code other than `200`.
